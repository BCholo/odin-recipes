        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Brazilian <em>bolo de cenoura</em>. is a fluffy and moist cake that is commonly served with a chocolate ganache topping. As opposed to other Brazilian desserts that originated with the Portuguese, <em>bolo de cenoura</em> is much more recent and began appearing in Brazilian cookbooks only in the 1960s. The inspiration behind <em>bolo de cenoura</em> comes from the American recipe for carrot cake.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Cake:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 ⅔ cups peeled and chopped carrots/li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Frosting</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 (3.5 ounce) bar bittersweet chocolate, broken into small pieces</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 13x9-inch baking pan.</li>
            <li>Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Blend oil, sugar, eggs, and carrots in a blender, stopping to scrape down sides, until creamy and smooth, about 1 minute. Pour puree into a large bowl, then whisk in flour mixture until combined. Pour batter into prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Transfer pan to a rack to cool, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Stir together milk, chocolate, honey, and butter in a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring constantly, until mixture is smooth, thick, and reduced to about 1 1/8 cups, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour frosting into a metal bowl and set in a larger bowl of ice water. Stir frosting until cooled and thickened, about 5 minutes. Frost cake evenly and cut into 12 pieces to serve.</li>
