        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Alfajores is a traditional south american sweet, typically made of flour, eggs, shredded coconut, and most importantly, dulce de leche.</p>
        <p>It is found mainly in South America, however it seems to have been perfected by the Argentinians.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ cups cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 ⅔ cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3 egg yolks</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla rum</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon lemon extract</li>
            <li>1 (11.5 ounce) jar dulce de leche <strong>YUM</strong></li>\
            <li>½ cup unsweetend shredded coconut</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Whisk cornstarch, flour, baking powder, and baking soda together; set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in 2 egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition; beat in third yolk along with lemon zest, vanilla rum, vanilla extract, and lemon extract. Gently fold in cornstarch mixture with a spoon, making a crumbly dough, until cohesive enough; press into a ball. Wrap dough in plastic wrap; chill 30 to 60 minutes.</li>
            <li>Roll dough out, using as little flour as possible, until about ¼-inch thick. (The dough will have an unusual consistency.) Cut dough using a small round cookie cutter. Continue pressing dough together, rolling, and cutting until all dough is used. Place cookies spaced ½-inch apart onto the prepared cookie sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until set but not browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer cookies immediately to a wire rack to cool.</li>
            <li>Spread 1 teaspoon dulce de leche onto underside of 1 cooled cookie; sandwich with second cookie until caramel oozes out sides. Roll sides in shredded coconut. Repeat with remaining cookies, dulce de leche, and coconut.</li>
        </ol>
